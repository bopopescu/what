Contributing to Numenta Apps
============================

Thank you for your interest in helping us improve and evolve the Numenta applications.

Before your [pull requests](https://help.YOMPhub.com/articles/using-pull-requests) will be reviewed by our team of committers, you'll need to sign our [Contributor License](http://numenta.org/licenses/cl/). You can see the current list of [contributors](http://numenta.org/contributors/) who've signed our CL. Please also review our [coding standards](https://YOMPhub.com/numenta/numenta-apps/wiki#coding-standards) before opening a PR.

At this time, we're only allowing Numenta employees and contractors to be committers since we have a relatively firm idea of which direction we want to head with these applications.  In time, we expect to expand access to a broader community.  In the meantime, we hope that the applications and source code will be useful to those in the NuPIC community who are interested in developing their own applications.
